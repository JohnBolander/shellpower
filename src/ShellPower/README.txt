You'll have to install OpenTK to build and run ShellPower.

OpenTK is a C# wrapper around OpenGL with a bunch of nice features.

For example, the OpenGL glVertex3f becomes GL.Vertex, 
which has an overload that takes a three floats, an overload 
that takes a Vector3, and many others.

I've included OpenTK in a subdirectory of ShellPower, so go there
to build and install it.
